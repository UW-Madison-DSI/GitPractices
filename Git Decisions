  Decisions about AFDSI repository use

1) Should the repositories be wide or narrow in focus
—Narrow repositories with the Project organizing them together
—Narrow repositories lead to redundant code
—Cross use repositories

2) What naming scheme for repositories should be used
3) How or when should we move existing projects onto the AFDSI page
4)How to store data:
—.gitignore - Easy to cause errors
—separate private repo
—separate not Uploaded directory
5)What is needed in a AFDSI repository template?
6)Use of Teams and Projects in AFDSI
